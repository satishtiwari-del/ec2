   - Manages conflicts
3. Users make changes
4. System syncs changes
5. System saves versions
6. Users complete editing

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: Sync conflicts
  1. System highlights conflicts
  2. Users resolve differences
- A2: Connection lost
  1. System saves local changes
  2. System resumes sync when possible

3. System displays metadata:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Tags
   - Custom fields
4. User modifies metadata
5. System validates changes
6. System saves updates
7. System logs changes

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: Invalid metadata
  1. System shows validation errors
  2. User corrects input
- A2: Required fields missing
  1. System highlights required
  2. User completes fields

**Post-conditions**:
- Metadata is updated
- Changes are logged
- Search index updated

### UC-FE-05: Version Management
**Primary Actor**: Creator
**Description**: Manage document versions
**Preconditions**: 
- User is authenticated as Creator
- Document has versions
- User has version rights

**Main Flow**:
1. User accesses version history
2. System displays versions:
   - Version numbers
   - Change dates
   - Authors
   - Comments
3. User manages versions:
   - Promotes version
   - Adds comments
   - Sets default
4. System applies changes
5. System updates history

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: Version restore
  1. User selects version

- A2: Version deletion
  1. System validates dependencies
  2. User confirms deletion
