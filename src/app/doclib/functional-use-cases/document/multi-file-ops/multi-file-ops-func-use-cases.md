## Business Rules
1. BR-MF-01: Batch operation consistency requirements:
   - All-or-nothing for critical operations
   - Partial success allowed for non-critical
   - Rollback on critical failure
2. BR-MF-02: Atomic operation rules:
   - Transaction isolation
   - Concurrent access protection
   - Operation ordering preserved
3. BR-MF-03: Partial success handling:
