## Introduction
This document outlines the functional use cases for the Folder Permissions feature of DocLib. The feature enables administrators and creators to manage access controls for folders and their contents.

## Use Cases

### UC-FP-01: View Folder Permissions
**Primary Actor**: Administrator/Creator
**Description**: View current permissions for a folder
**Preconditions**: 
- User is authenticated
- User has permission to view access controls

**Main Flow**:
1. User selects folder
2. User accesses permissions view
3. System displays:
   - Direct permissions
   - Inherited permissions
   - User/Group assignments
   - Permission levels
4. User can view detailed settings

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: No permissions set
  1. System shows default permissions
  2. System indicates inheritance status
- A2: Access denied
  1. System shows error message
  2. System logs access attempt

**Post-conditions**:
- Permissions displayed
- Audit log updated
- No changes made

### UC-FP-02: Modify Folder Permissions
**Primary Actor**: Administrator
**Description**: Change permissions for a folder
**Preconditions**: 
- User is authenticated as Administrator
- Folder exists
- User has modify rights

**Main Flow**:
1. User accesses permission settings
2. User modifies permissions:
   - Add/remove users/groups
   - Change permission levels
   - Set inheritance rules
3. System validates changes
4. System applies modifications
5. System confirms changes

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: Invalid permission combination
  1. System shows validation error
  2. User corrects settings
- A2: Conflict with inheritance
  1. System prompts for resolution
  2. User chooses action

**Post-conditions**:
- Permissions updated
- Changes logged
- Users notified if needed

### UC-FP-03: Permission Inheritance Management
**Primary Actor**: Administrator
**Description**: Manage permission inheritance rules
**Preconditions**: 
- User is authenticated as Administrator
- Folder hierarchy exists

**Main Flow**:
1. User selects inheritance options
2. User chooses:
   - Break inheritance
   - Restore inheritance
   - Copy permissions
3. System validates impact
4. System applies changes
5. System updates subfolders

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: Subfolder conflicts
  1. System shows affected items
  2. User resolves conflicts
- A2: Critical permission loss
  1. System warns of impact
  2. User confirms or cancels

**Post-conditions**:
- Inheritance updated
- Subfolder permissions adjusted
- Changes logged

### UC-FP-04: Bulk Permission Updates
**Primary Actor**: Administrator
**Description**: Update permissions for multiple folders
**Preconditions**: 
- User is authenticated as Administrator
- Multiple folders selected
- User has bulk modify rights

**Main Flow**:
1. User selects multiple folders
2. User accesses bulk permissions
3. User specifies changes:
   - Common permissions
   - Inheritance rules
   - User/Group assignments
4. System validates changes
5. System applies updates
6. System confirms completion

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: Partial success
  1. System shows failed items
  2. User addresses failures
- A2: Validation errors
  1. System lists issues
  2. User corrects or skips

**Post-conditions**:
- Bulk updates applied
- Failed items reported
- Audit log updated

### UC-FP-05: Permission Audit and Review
**Primary Actor**: Administrator
**Description**: Review and audit permission changes
**Preconditions**: 
- User is authenticated as Administrator
- Audit logging enabled

**Main Flow**:
1. User accesses audit view
2. User specifies filters:
   - Date range
   - Users/Groups
   - Permission types
   - Folders
3. System displays audit log
4. User reviews changes
5. User exports report (optional)

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: No audit data
  1. System shows empty state
  2. User adjusts filters
- A2: Export error
  1. System retries export
  2. User chooses format

**Post-conditions**:
- Audit data displayed
- Report generated (if requested)
- No changes made

## Business Rules
1. BR-FP-01: Administrator always retains access
2. BR-FP-02: Inheritance follows folder hierarchy
3. BR-FP-03: Permission changes require confirmation
4. BR-FP-04: Audit trail mandatory for changes
5. BR-FP-05: Critical folders require dual control

## Assumptions and Dependencies
1. Role-based access control system exists
2. User/Group management system available
3. Audit logging system operational
4. Notification system available

## Glossary
- **Permission Level**: Access rights definition
- **Inheritance**: Propagation of permissions
- **Direct Permission**: Explicitly set access
- **Bulk Update**: Multiple folder modification
- **Audit Trail**: Change history log
