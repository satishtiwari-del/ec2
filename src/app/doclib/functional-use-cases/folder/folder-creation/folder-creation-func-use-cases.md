### Use Case 1: Create New Folder with Metadata
**ID**: UC-f7d3e9b0-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567

**Context**: Users need to create folders with rich metadata to better organize and categorize their documents. The metadata helps in searching, filtering, and maintaining a structured document hierarchy.

**Actor**: Application User

**Precondition**: 
- User is authenticated
- User has permissions to create folders in the current location
- User is in a valid location where folder creation is allowed

**Main Flow**:
1. User initiates folder creation (via button or context menu)
2. System displays folder creation dialog
3. User enters folder name: "Project Documents"
4. User selects an icon for the folder
5. User enters optional description: "Contains all project-related documentation"
6. User adds tags: "project", "documentation", "2024"
7. User clicks "Create" button
8. System validates the input
9. System creates the folder with metadata
10. System displays success message
11. System updates the folder list to show the new folder

**Postcondition**: 
- New folder is created with all specified metadata
- Folder is visible in the current location
- User can start using the folder

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: Invalid folder name
  1. System shows error message
  2. Keeps dialog open for correction
- A2: Duplicate folder name
  1. System shows warning
  2. Prompts user to choose different name
- A3: User cancels creation
  1. System closes dialog
  2. No folder is created

**Business Rules**:
- Folder names must be unique within the same location
- Folder name cannot contain invalid characters (/, \, :, *, ?, ", <, >, |)
- Maximum folder name length: 255 characters
- Maximum description length: 1000 characters
- Maximum tags per folder: 20

**Data Requirements**:
- Folder Name (required, string)
- Icon (required, valid image file or icon selection)
- Description (optional, string)
- Tags (optional, array of strings)
- Creation Timestamp (system-generated)
- Creator ID (system-generated)

**Success Criteria**:
- Folder is created with all specified metadata
- User can immediately navigate into the new folder
- Folder appears in search results when searching by name, description, or tags
- Creation process takes less than 3 seconds

### Use Case 2: Manage Folder through Context Menu
**ID**: UC-a8b9c0d1-2345-6789-01ab-cdef23456789

**Context**: Users need quick access to common folder operations through a context menu interface to improve productivity and workflow efficiency.

**Actor**: Application User

**Precondition**:
- User is authenticated
- User has appropriate permissions for the folder
- Folder exists in the system

**Main Flow**:
1. User right-clicks on a folder
2. System displays context menu with options:
   - New Folder
   - Upload File
   - Edit
   - Delete
   - Move
   - Copy
   - Rename
3. User selects an operation
4. System initiates the selected operation workflow

**Postcondition**:
- Context menu is displayed with all available operations
- Selected operation is initiated
- User can proceed with the chosen action

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: Insufficient permissions
  1. System grays out unauthorized operations
  2. Shows tooltip explaining why operation is unavailable
- A2: Operation in progress
  1. System shows operation status
  2. Prevents conflicting operations
- A3: System error
  1. Shows error message
  2. Logs error for troubleshooting

**Business Rules**:
- Operations availability based on user permissions
- Certain operations may be restricted based on folder content
- System must prevent concurrent conflicting operations
- Delete operation requires confirmation
- Move/Copy operations must validate target location permissions

**Data Requirements**:
- Folder ID
- User Permissions
- Operation Type
- Target Location (for move/copy)
- Confirmation Status (for delete)

**Success Criteria**:
- Context menu appears within 0.5 seconds of right-click
- All available operations are clearly visible
- Operations execute without errors
- User receives clear feedback for each action
- System maintains data integrity during operations
