# Technical Use Case Examples

## Overview
This document provides example technical use cases, each mapped to a functional use case. **Functional Use Cases are referenced as the primary input.**

---

## 1. User Authentication and Authorization System

### Technical Use Case 1.1: Multi-Factor Authentication Implementation
**References Functional Use Case:** Multi-Factor Authentication Flow

**Technical Context:**
- Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt/argon2)
- Implement OTP generation and validation (time-based, 6 digits)
- Integrate with SMS/email provider for code delivery
- Enforce rate limiting and account lockout after failed attempts
- Use JWT or session tokens for authentication
- Log all authentication events for audit

**Architecture/Flow:**
1. User submits credentials; backend validates using secure hash
2. If valid, backend generates OTP and sends via SMS/email
3. User submits OTP; backend validates code and creates session/JWT
4. On success, user is authenticated; on failure, increment attempt counter
5. Lock account after N failed attempts; allow unlock via admin or after timeout

**Security:**
- All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- OTPs expire after 5 minutes
- Audit logs for all auth events

**Performance:**
- OTP and login endpoints must respond within 2 seconds under load

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for OTP logic, integration tests for SMS/email delivery, security tests for brute force

## 2. Data Management and CRUD Operations

### Technical Use Case 2.1: Product Data Validation and Processing
**References Functional Use Case:** Complex Data Validation and Processing

**Technical Context:**
- Use schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema, Joi)
- Enforce unique constraints (e.g., SKU)
- Implement real-time validation on frontend and backend
- Use transactional database operations for save
- Trigger notifications on successful save

**Architecture/Flow:**
1. User submits product form; frontend validates fields
2. Backend validates data against schema and business rules
3. On success, save product in DB and trigger inventory update
4. On failure, return validation errors to user

**Error Handling:**
- Return detailed error messages for each invalid field
- Log all failed validation attempts

**Testing:**
- Automated tests for all validation rules and business logic

## 3. Real-Time Communication System

### Technical Use Case 3.1: WebSocket Chat Backend
**References Functional Use Case:** WebSocket-Based Chat Application

**Technical Context:**
- Use WebSocket server (e.g., Socket.IO, ws)
- Store messages in persistent database
- Implement message broadcast to all room participants
- Track online/offline status
- Enforce message length/content rules

**Architecture/Flow:**
1. Client connects to WebSocket server
2. Server authenticates user and joins room
3. Messages are validated, stored, and broadcast
4. Presence updates sent to all clients

**Error Handling:**
- Queue messages if connection lost
- Notify admin on inappropriate content

**Testing:**
- Load test for concurrent connections, integration test for message delivery

## 4. Advanced Search and Filtering System

### Technical Use Case 4.1: Elasticsearch Integration
**References Functional Use Case:** Elasticsearch-Powered Search

**Technical Context:**
- Use Elasticsearch for indexing and search
- Map product data to ES schema
- Implement query parsing and filter translation
- Paginate and rank results

**Architecture/Flow:**
1. User submits search query; backend parses and builds ES query
2. ES returns results; backend applies ranking and pagination
3. Return top N results to frontend

**Performance:**
- Search must return results within 1 second for up to 1M records

**Testing:**
- Test for query accuracy, performance under load, and edge cases

---

## 5. Workflow and Business Process Automation

### Technical Use Case 5.1: Document Approval Workflow Engine
**References Functional Use Case:** Document Approval Workflow

**Technical Context:**
- Use workflow/state machine library
- Store workflow state and history in DB
- Notify approvers via email/in-app
- Support parallel and sequential approvals
- Escalate on timeout

**Architecture/Flow:**
1. On document submit, create workflow instance
2. Notify first approver; on approval, move to next stage
3. Track all actions and comments
4. Escalate if timeout; finalize on all approvals

**Testing:**
- Simulate all approval paths, test escalations, audit logs
