# Technical Use Case Reviewer

## Overview
This document defines the review process for technical use cases from multiple technical stakeholder perspectives to ensure comprehensive validation, implementation readiness, and quality assurance. All technical use cases must be traceable to their corresponding functional use cases.

## Input Files for Review Process
**System Note:** The system will receive references to all technical use case file names that are to be reviewed. The system should display the names of all target files for this review session.

**[UX Instructions for the System]**
- Present the list of technical use case files to be reviewed
- Ask user to proceed with the files received
- Provide two clear options in chat interface:
  - "Abort" (to cancel the review session)
  - "Proceed" (to continue with the review)

## Review Process Workflow

### Step 1: Document Format Review
**System Note:** Before proceeding with perspective-based reviews, conduct a comprehensive document format review against `gen-cycle-guidelines.md` to ensure all documents meet the required standards and formatting requirements.

**[UX Instructions for the System]**
- Inform user: "Starting technical use case document format review against gen-cycle-guidelines.md..."
- Conduct systematic review of each document for:
  - Template compliance
  - Required sections presence
  - Placeholder replacement validation
  - AIGEN-Cycle UUID should get populated from Functional Use Case documents, which are provided as input to this process. Confirm and display for user. (CRITICAL)
  - User Inputs Summary completeness
  - Document metadata sections
  - Technical use case specific requirements

#### AIGEN-Cycle UUID Validation (CRITICAL)
**System Note:** All AIGEN-Cycle UUID validation requirements are centrally defined.

> **REFERENCE**: For complete AIGEN-Cycle UUID validation criteria, format requirements, and traceability guidelines, refer to [`gen-cycle-guidelines.md ## AIGEN-Cycle Integration with Document Generation`](../00-common/gen-cycle-guidelines.md#aigen-cycle-integration-with-document-generation)

**Additional Technical Validation:**
- [ ] AIGEN-Cycle UUID is derived from Functional Use Case documents as used in all the generated documents in this cycle
- [ ] AIGEN-Cycle UUID matches the functional use case AIGEN-Cycle UUID (for traceability)


#### Technical Use Case Specific Validation
**Check for each technical use case document:**
- [ ] **Functional Use Case Traceability**: Each technical use case references its source functional use case(s) with unique IDs
- [ ] **Angular Framework Compliance**: References to Angular best practices and framework requirements
- [ ] **Testing Requirements**: Jasmine + Angular Testing Utilities specifications included
- [ ] **Standards References**: Links to established guidelines (ng-best-practices.md, coding guidelines, etc.)
- [ ] **Security & Performance Specifications**: Measurable requirements and implementation details
- [ ] **Component Architecture**: Angular component, pipe, and service design requirements

#### Document Structure Validation
**Check for each document:**
- [ ] Document follows `tech-use-case-doc-template.md` structure
- [ ] All required technical sections are present
- [ ] Placeholders (surrounded with `[]`) have been replaced with actual technical information
- [ ] Template instruction sections (inside `*( )*`) have been removed
- [ ] User Inputs Summary section includes Angular/UX-UI specific configurations
- [ ] DOCUMENT CREATION section contains all required metadata
- [ ] DOCUMENT UPDATE LOG section is present (empty for new documents)

**[UX Instructions for the System]**
- After format review, provide summary: "Technical use case document format review completed. Found [X] issues across [Y] documents."
- If issues found, list specific problems and ask user if they want to:
  - "Fix format issues first" (recommended)
  - "Proceed with technical perspective review despite format issues"
  - "Abort review process"
- If no issues found, proceed to technical perspective selection

### Step 2: Technical Perspective Selection
We need to review technical use cases from multiple technical stakeholder perspectives to ensure comprehensive validation and implementation readiness.

**[UX Instructions for the System]**
- Prompt the user with: `Review {{repeat?again:""}} as - Senior Software Architect | Lead Angular Developer | DevOps Engineer | QA Lead | Security Engineer | Performance Engineer?`
- Provide guidance note: "You can type your options with combinations like - 'Senior Software Architect and Lead Angular Developer'. You can also choose to abort the review process."
- Confirm user's choice: "Review aforesaid technical use case documents as {{options given by user}}"
- Present confirmation options: "Yes" & "No"
- If user chooses "Yes", proceed with the review from the chosen technical perspective(s)

### Step 3: Technical Review Execution
**System Note:** Execute the technical review based on the selected perspective(s) using the criteria from `tech-use-case-review-guidelines.md` and provide a comprehensive review summary.

### Step 4: Review Summary and Next Steps
**System Note:** After completing the technical review, provide a detailed summary and ask the user to proceed with updates or modifications.

## Review Cycles
Users may choose to perform multiple review cycles to ensure thorough validation from different technical perspectives.

**[UX Instructions for the System]**
- After each review cycle, circle back to the "Review Process Workflow" section
- Allow users to select different technical perspectives for subsequent review cycles
- Maintain session state to track completed reviews and remaining perspectives
