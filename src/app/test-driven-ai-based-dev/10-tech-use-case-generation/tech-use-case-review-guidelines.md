# Technical Use Case Review Guidelines for AI

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive framework for reviewing technical use cases. **All technical use cases must be traceable to their functional use case inputs.**

## Review Categories

### 1. Traceability
- [ ] Each technical use case references its functional use case(s)
- [ ] Mapping is clear and unambiguous

### 2. Architecture & Design
- [ ] System/component architecture is clearly described
- [ ] Technology stack is specified
- [ ] Data flow and interfaces are defined
- [ ] Integration points are documented

### 3. Security & Compliance
- [ ] Security requirements are addressed (auth, encryption, etc.)
- [ ] Compliance/privacy requirements are included
- [ ] Sensitive data handling is specified

### 4. Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] Error and exception handling is defined
- [ ] Failure scenarios and recovery are covered
- [ ] Logging and monitoring are specified

### 5. Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Performance requirements are stated
- [ ] Scalability considerations are included
- [ ] Load and stress scenarios are addressed

### 6. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Testability is addressed (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Validation criteria are clear
- [ ] Edge cases and failure modes are covered

### 7. Deployment & Operations
- [ ] Deployment requirements are specified
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are included
- [ ] Rollback and recovery are addressed

### 8. Clarity & Consistency
- [ ] Technical language is clear and precise
- [ ] Diagrams/pseudocode are used where helpful
- [ ] Consistent terminology and structure

### 9. Angular Framework Compliance
- [ ] Components follow standalone component architecture (no NgModules)
- [ ] Components use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- [ ] State management uses signals and `computed()` for derived state
- [ ] Components implement `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`
- [ ] Templates use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`)
- [ ] Services use `providedIn: 'root'` and `inject()` function
- [ ] Reactive forms are preferred over template-driven forms
- [ ] Lazy loading is implemented for feature routes

### 10. Angular Component & Pipe Architecture
- [ ] Components are small and focused on single responsibility
- [ ] Component hierarchy and communication patterns are well-defined
- [ ] Custom pipes are pure and handle edge cases
- [ ] Pipe transformation logic is clearly documented
- [ ] Component lifecycle hooks are properly utilized
- [ ] Event handling and data binding are efficiently implemented
- [ ] Component reusability and configurability are addressed

### 11. Angular Testing Framework Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests use Jasmine + Angular Testing Utilities framework
- [ ] Test files follow naming convention: `[component-name].component.spec.ts`
- [ ] Tests achieve minimum 80% code coverage requirement
- [ ] `TestBed` configuration is properly set up for component testing
- [ ] Component DOM testing covers user interactions
- [ ] Service testing includes HTTP mocking with `HttpClientTestingModule`
- [ ] Async operations are properly tested with observables
- [ ] Integration tests are located in `[module]/tests/integration/` folders

### 12. References to Existing Components & Standards
- [ ] Implementation follows [Angular/TypeScript Project Structure Guidelines](../00-common/ng-ts-proj-structure-guidelines.md)
- [ ] Code adheres to [OptimaStride Coding Guidelines](../../../../guidelines/coding-guideline.md)
- [ ] Testing follows [Unit Testing Guidelines](../../../../guidelines/unit-testing-guildeline.md)
- [ ] Components reference [Angular Best Practices](../00-common/ng-best-practices.md)
- [ ] Existing shared components are reused from `src/app/shared/components/`
- [ ] Common patterns follow established modules in `src/app/modules/`
- [ ] CI/CD integration uses `ng test --no-watch --no-progress --browsers=ChromeHeadless`

## Scoring System
- **Excellent (5/5):** Meets all criteria, ready for implementation
- **Good (4/5):** Minor issues, needs minimal revision
- **Acceptable (3/5):** Some issues, needs moderate revision
- **Needs Work (2/5):** Significant issues, needs major revision
- **Poor (1/5):** Major issues, needs complete rewrite

## Review Output Format
For each technical use case, provide:
- **Overall Score** (1-5)
- **Category Scores** (per above)
- **Issues Found**
- **Recommendations**
- **Priority** (High/Medium/Low)

## Automated Review Instructions
- Apply all checklist items systematically
- Score each category independently
- Provide actionable feedback
- Ensure traceability to functional use cases
- Maintain consistency across reviews
