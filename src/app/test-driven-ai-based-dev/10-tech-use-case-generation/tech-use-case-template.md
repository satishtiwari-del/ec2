# Individual Technical Use Case Template

## Use Case Components

### Required Components

#### Reference to Functional Use Case
- Clearly state which functional use case(s) this technical use case implements

#### Technical Context
- Purpose and rationale for technical implementation
- Key technical constraints or requirements

#### System/Component Architecture
- High-level architecture diagram or description
- Technology stack and major components

#### Data Model and Flow
- Data structures, schemas, and flow between components

#### Integration & Interfaces
- External/internal systems, APIs, protocols, and data contracts

#### Error & Exception Handling
- How errors are detected, reported, and recovered
- Logging and monitoring requirements

#### Security & Compliance
- Authentication, authorization, encryption, privacy, compliance

#### Performance & Scalability
- Performance targets, scalability strategies, load considerations

#### Testing & Validation
- Testability, validation criteria, test types (unit, integration, E2E)

#### Deployment & Operations
- Deployment requirements, monitoring, rollback, operational notes

### Optional Components

#### Diagrams & Pseudocode
- **DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE IN TECHNICAL USE CASES. PSEUDOCODE is fine**
- Sequence diagrams, flowcharts, pseudocode for complex logic

#### Versioning & Traceability
- Version info, links to functional use case versions, change log
