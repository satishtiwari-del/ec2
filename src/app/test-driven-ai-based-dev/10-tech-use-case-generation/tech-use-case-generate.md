## Instructions for AI

You are a Solution Architect or a Senior Software Engineer. Generate comprehensive technical use cases for the specified feature/module/application, using the corresponding Functional Use Cases as your primary input.

## Input To This Phase & Summary
**AIGEN-Cycle UUID Handling:**
- **When Running in Pipeline Succession**: UUID automatically passed from PIPE A
- **When Running Independently**: You MUST provide the AIGEN-Cycle UUID
  - Format: See [`gen-cycle-guidelines.md`](../00-common/gen-cycle-guidelines.md#aigen-cycle-uuid-format-critical) for format requirements
  - Must match UUID from your Functional Use Cases
  - Pipeline will block if UUID missing or mismatched

**Primary Inputs Required:**
- **AIGEN-Cycle UUID**: [Auto-supplied in succession, REQUIRED if running independently]
- **Functional Use Case File(s)**: [REQUIRED] Path(s) to functional use case document(s)
- **Technical Constraints**: [Optional] Stack, integration, compliance requirements
- **Target Level**: [Will be extracted from Functional Use Cases]
- **Application/Module/Feature/Enhancement Name**: [Will be extracted from Functional Use Cases]
- **Business/Functional Context**: [Will be extracted from Functional Use Cases]

**Note on Independent Execution:**
If running this pipe independently (not in succession from PIPE A):
1. First provide the AIGEN-Cycle UUID
2. Then provide paths to Functional Use Cases
3. Pipeline will validate UUID matches Functional Use Cases

## Primary Inputs from The User
- **Prompt the user for following information**
- **Technical Constraints - Modules**: [If scope is Module: Ask, optionally, for Comma delimited list of related existing modules. Suggest list of existing features.]
- **Technical Constraints - Features**: [If scope is Feature: Ask, optionally, for Comma delimited list of related features in the same module. Suggest list of existing features.]
- **Technical Constraints - Enhancements**: [If scope is Enhancements: Ask, optionally, for Comma delimited list of related features in the same module. Suggest list of existing 
- **List top level Technical Constraints/Preference**: [Optional: e.g., stack, integration, compliance. Suggest list.]
- **Technical Constraints/Preferences - Misc**: [Optional: e.g., stack, integration, compliance. Suggest list.]
- **Technical Use-case Output Location Root**: [Suggest & prompt]

## Framework Detection and Confirmation

**Framework Detection Process**:
1. First, I will analyze the project setup and existing technical constraints
2. If a framework is already specified:
   - I will use the specified framework
   - Display: "Detected Framework: [FRAMEWORK_NAME]"
3. If no framework is specified:
   - Display: "No framework specified. I will use Angular (latest stable version) as the application framework."
   - Ask: "Would you like to proceed with Angular or prefer a different framework?"
     - If Angular accepted: Proceed with Angular-specific inputs below
     - If denied: Prompt for preferred framework choice

## Angular UX/UI Project Specific Inputs
**When Angular is confirmed as the framework, prompt for the following requirements:**

### Angular Framework Configuration
- **Angular Version**: 
  - Default: Latest stable version (20+)
  - Ask: "Shall I proceed with Angular [LATEST_VERSION], or do you need a specific version?"
  - If different version needed, note compatibility considerations

### Component Generation Strategy  
- **Angular CLI Usage**: Confirm Angular CLI for component generation
  - Default: Yes, using Angular CLI
  - Document CLI commands and schematics to be used
  - Specify any custom schematics or configuration requirements

### UI Library Selection
- **UI Framework Choice**: Ask user to select UI library preference:
  - **Option A**: Angular Material (Google's Material Design components)
  - **Option B**: CoreUI (Bootstrap-based Angular components)
  - **Option C**: Custom UI library (specify if different library required)
- Document selected UI library integration requirements and theming considerations

### API Integration Configuration
- **API Endpoint Configuration**: If technical use case involves API integration:
  - **API BasePath**: Prompt for API endpoint base URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com/v1/`)
  - **Authentication**: Confirm API authentication method (Bearer token, API key, etc.)
  - **API Documentation**: Request API documentation or OpenAPI/Swagger specification link

### API Development Strategy (When API Not Available)
- **Missing API Handling**: If API is required but not yet implemented:
  - **Suggest Fake API**: Recommend using fake/mock API for development
    - Suggest tools like JSON Server, MSW (Mock Service Worker), or Angular interceptors
    - Confirm user preference for mocking strategy
  - **API Contract Definition**: Define expected API contract structure
  - **Migration Strategy**: Document transition plan from fake to real API

### Additional UX/UI Considerations
- **Responsive Design**: Confirm responsive design requirements (mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints)
- **Accessibility**: Confirm WCAG compliance level requirements (A, AA, AAA)
- **Browser Support**: Define minimum browser version support requirements
- **Theme/Branding**: Confirm if custom theming or branding guidelines exist

## Requirements
- For each functional use case, generate a corresponding technical use case
- Detail system architecture, technology stack, data flow, error handling, security, performance, integration, and other technical aspects
- Reference the functional use case for business context and flows
- Ensure all technical requirements are testable and measurable
- Use precise technical terminology
- Avoid repeating business logic unless needed for clarity
- **MUST include all sections detailed in "Technical Use Case Content Requirements" below**
