**User**

Revisit the examples and remove all requirements/flow that talks about technical/implementation aspects. Exasmples should only focus on functional part of the use-case.

Let's put these instructions in @@use-case-general-guideline.md

Since we are going to give technical aspects of the functrionality in @tech-use-case-examples.md, whatever technical parts you remove from this document, keep as not in  @tech-use-case-examples.md. Will be useful later.

# Use Case General Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for creating functional use cases that focus purely on business requirements and user interactions, without technical implementation details.

## Core Principles

### 1. Focus on Functional Requirements
- **Business Value**: Every use case should deliver clear business value
- **User-Centric**: Describe what users want to accomplish, not how to implement it
- **Domain Language**: Use business terminology, not technical jargon
- **Clear Outcomes**: Define what success looks like from a business perspective

### 2. Structure Guidelines

#### Use Case Components
- **Context**: Why is this functionality needed?
- **Actor**: Who is performing the action?
- **Precondition**: What must be true before this can happen?
- **Main Flow**: Step-by-step user actions and system responses
- **Postcondition**: What is the business outcome?
- **Alternative Flows**: What happens when things go wrong or take different paths?

#### What to Include
- User actions and decisions
- System responses and validations
- Business rules and constraints
- Data that users provide or receive
- Business outcomes and notifications

#### What to Exclude
- Technical implementation details
- Database schemas or queries
- API specifications
- Technology choices
- Performance requirements
- Security implementation details
- Error handling mechanisms
- Caching strategies
- Deployment considerations

### 3. Writing Style Guidelines

#### Use Business Language
- ✅ "User submits expense report for approval"
- ❌ "User clicks submit button which triggers API call to backend"

#### Focus on User Goals
- ✅ "User wants to track project progress"
- ❌ "System displays progress bar component"

#### Describe Business Rules
- ✅ "Approval requires manager signature"
- ❌ "System validates user permissions using JWT tokens"

#### Define Business Outcomes
- ✅ "Order is confirmed and customer receives confirmation"
- ❌ "Order status is updated in database and email is sent"

### 4. Examples of Good vs Bad Use Cases

#### Good Example
```
**Use Case**: User Registration
**Context**: New users need to create accounts to access the system
**Actor**: Prospective User
**Precondition**: User has valid email address
**Main Flow**:
1. User navigates to registration page
2. User enters email address
3. User creates password
4. User provides name and contact information
5. User accepts terms and conditions
6. System validates information
7. System creates user account
8. System sends welcome email
**Postcondition**: User can log in and access system features
```

#### Bad Example (Too Technical)
```
**Use Case**: User Registration
**Context**: System needs to create user records in database
**Actor**: Prospective User
**Precondition**: Database connection is available
**Main Flow**:
1. User submits form data
2. System validates input using regex patterns
3. System hashes password with bcrypt
4. System inserts record into users table
5. System generates JWT token
6. System sends email via SMTP
**Postcondition**: User record exists in database
```

### 5. Alternative Flows Guidelines

#### Business-Focused Alternatives
- User provides invalid information
- User cancels the process
- System detects duplicate information
- User doesn't have required permissions
- Business rules prevent the action

#### Avoid Technical Alternatives
- Database connection fails
- API timeout occurs
- Memory allocation fails
- Network connectivity issues
- Server crashes

### 6. Validation Guidelines

#### Ask These Questions
- Does this describe what the user wants to accomplish?
- Is the business value clear?
- Can a non-technical person understand this?
- Does it focus on user interactions and business outcomes?
- Would this help a business analyst understand the requirement?

#### Red Flags to Remove
- Technical implementation details
- Database or API specifications
- Performance or scalability concerns
- Security implementation details
- Technology stack references
- Error handling mechanisms
- Caching or optimization strategies

### 7. Collaboration Guidelines

#### With Business Stakeholders
- Use cases should be understandable by business users
- Focus on business processes and workflows
- Use domain-specific terminology
- Validate business rules and requirements

#### With Development Team
- Technical requirements will be derived from functional use cases
- Implementation details will be specified in technical use cases
- Performance and security requirements will be addressed separately
- Technology choices will be made based on functional requirements

### 8. Template for Functional Use Cases

```
## [Feature Name]

### Use Case [Number]: [Specific Functionality]
**Context**: [Why is this needed from a business perspective?]

**Actor**: [Who performs this action?]

**Precondition**: [What business conditions must be met?]

**Main Flow**:
1. [User action or system response]
2. [User action or system response]
3. [Continue with business-focused steps]

**Postcondition**: [What business outcome is achieved?]

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: [Business-focused alternative]
- A2: [Business-focused alternative]
- A3: [Business-focused alternative]
```

### 9. Quality Checklist

#### Functional Focus
- [ ] Describes user goals and business value
- [ ] Uses business terminology
- [ ] Focuses on user interactions
- [ ] Defines business outcomes
- [ ] Avoids technical implementation details

#### Completeness
- [ ] Covers main user journey
- [ ] Includes relevant alternative flows
- [ ] Defines clear preconditions
- [ ] Specifies business postconditions
- [ ] Addresses business rules

#### Clarity
- [ ] Non-technical stakeholders can understand
- [ ] Business value is clear
- [ ] User actions are specific
- [ ] System responses are business-focused
- [ ] Outcomes are measurable

This guideline ensures that use cases remain focused on functional requirements and business value, making them accessible to all stakeholders while providing a solid foundation for technical implementation.

- **Guidelines**: Provides principles and best practices for writing use cases

### 2. **Better Organization**
- Template focuses on "how to structure" use cases
- Guidelines focus on "how to write good" use cases
- Each document has a clear, focused purpose

### 3. **Enhanced Usability**
- Template can be used as a direct reference for creating use cases
- Guidelines provide the context and principles behind the template
- Easier to find specific information when needed

### 4. **Improved Maintainability**
