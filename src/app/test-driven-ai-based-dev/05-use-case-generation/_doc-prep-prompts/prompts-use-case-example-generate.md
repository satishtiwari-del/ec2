# PROMPTS FOR FUNCTIONAL USE CASE GENERATION

Following prompt was given to generate 
### PROMPT 1
```
You are an Architect and generating use case examples for app/feature/module. Give detailed examples which lead to getting deterministic code suggestions based on these examples as one of the inputs.
```
### PROMPT 2
```
Let's remove Technical Implementation Guidelines from this document and move them into @tech-use-case-general-guideline.md 
```
### PROMPT 3
```
Revisit the examples and remove all requirements/flow that talks about technical/implementation aspects. Exasmples should only focus on functional part of the use-case.

Let's put these instructions in @use-case-general-guideline.md

Since we are going to give technical aspects of the functrionality in @tech-use-case-examples.md, whatever technical parts you remove from this document, keep as note in  @tech-use-case-examples.md. Will be useful later.
```

### PROMPT 4
```
Let's move Use Case Components section to @use-case-template.md 
```
